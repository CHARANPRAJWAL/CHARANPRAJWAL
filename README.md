### 🚀 About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer with 2+ years of experience building and automating cloud-native infrastructure. I specialize in:

- ⚙️ CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI
- ☸️ Kubernetes deployments and Helm-based GitOps with ArgoCD
- ☁️ Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Ansible
- 📈 Building observability platforms with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry

I love designing tools and processes that **make life easier for developers** and **more stable for systems**. Whether it’s automating repetitive ops tasks, enabling self-service provisioning, or improving deployment reliability—I'm always looking for better, simpler ways to scale engineering.
